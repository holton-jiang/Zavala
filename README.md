# Zavala

A dedicated outliner for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS.

## Community

Let's talk outliners! Head over to [Discussions](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions) for outliner discussion and to express what you would like to see in an outliner application. Be sure to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/wiki/Code-of-Conduct).

## User Contributions

We are looking for active user contributors.  We need people to test the application and provide feedback, including your
ideas about what you would like to see in an outliner.  If you find a bug and it isn't already in 
[Issues](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/issues), you can add it there.  If you have an idea you would like see implemented,
bring it up in [Discussions](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions).

This is your chance to help shape what Zavala will become but, we aren't looking to build an outliner by committee.  Not all features
can be implemented due to time constraints. Some features can't be implemented because they conflict with other ones.  We also
have specific [Design Goals](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/wiki/Design-Goals).  All input is welcome, but the primary
project contributors have final say in the design.

Keep in mind, this is an application in the very early stages of development.  You should not entrust any important information
to it.  It is buggy and incomplete.  It may be very frustrating to use right now.  Here is the application for only the bravest
of users to try out.

## Code Contributions

We are not currently looking for additional code contributors yet. The project is in such an early state of development
that too many people working on the code would be chaotic. That will change as the project matures. I'll update
this README when we get to that point.

## Credits

I would like to thank [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com)
for inspiring this project. Their dedication to outliners and disatisfaction with the current generation of
them is ultimately what got this project going.  In fact John [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1277329886080905219) this:

> I would kill for a good simple outliner that synced across iOS and Mac, and had a great *simple* UI on all three platforms.

If there was a mission statement for Zavala, that would be it.
