# Zavala

A dedicated outliner for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS.

## Contributing

We are not currently looking for additional contributors yet. The project is in such an early state of development
that too many people working on the code would be chaotic. That will change as the project matures. I'll update
this README when we get to that point.

## Community

Let's talk outliners! Head over to [Discussions](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions) for outliner discussion and to express what you would like to see in an outliner application. Be sure to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/wiki/Code-of-Conduct).

## Credits

I would like to thank [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com)
for inspiring this project. Their dedication to outliners and disatisfaction with the current generation of
them is ultimately what got this project going.  In fact John [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1277329886080905219) this:

> I would kill for a good simple outliner that synced across iOS and Mac, and had a great *simple* UI on all three platforms.

If there was a mission statement for Zavala, that would be it.
