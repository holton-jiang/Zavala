## Windows

When there are no windows open and Zavala gets activated the [Open Quickly](Open_Quickly.md) window will open. If you don’t like this behavior, you can select “Use Main Window as Default” to open the [Main Window](Main_Window.md) instead.

## Accounts

There are only two Accounts available in Zavala. The On My Device Account and the iCloud Account. They behave a little differently from each other.

### On My Device

This account is either On My iPhone, On My iPad, or On My Mac depending on the device you are using. It is the default Account when you first start Zavala.

When you disable the On My Device account, nothing gets deleted. As soon as you reenable it, you have access to the Outlines that you had associated with it.

### iCloud

The iCloud Account can be enabled if you have [iCloud Drive](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025) set up. Use this Account if you want to access and edit your Outlines on multiple devices that you have Zavala installed on. You can also [collaborate](Collaborating_on_an_Outline.md) on an Outline with a friend or associate using the iCloud Account.

When you disable the iCloud account all the iCloud Outlines on your device will be deleted. They won’t be deleted from iCloud and will still be available on your other devices. To delete all your Outlines from iCloud and all devices, you need to use the iCloud pane in System Preferences.

## Owner Information

This is the default information that gets added to each Outline that you create. It is used when exporting OPML files.
