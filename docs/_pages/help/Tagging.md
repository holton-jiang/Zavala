## Organizing Outlines

Zavala uses Tags to organize Outlines. You create a Tag by typing into the Tag entry field located just under the Outline Title field. Zavala will automatically add or remove Tags as needed from the Collections (Sidebar) View.

## Basic Usage

Tags are completely optional. If you have a small number of Outlines, you might not need or want to use Tags. A Tag can be a word that has some significance for the Outline. Unlike hashtags, you can also use multiple words with spaces between them in Zavala.

Once you create a Tag, you can select it in the Collections View to easily find Outlines with that Tag. An Outline can have multiple Tags. If you select more than one Tag in the Collections View, only Outlines with all the selected Tags are show.

## Nested Tags

Nested Tags are useful if you have a large number of Outlines to keep track of. You create a Nested Tag by entering multiple words into the Tag entry field with a forward slash separating them. For example “Zavala/Releases” is a Nested Tag that I use to tag Outlines that have Zavala’s release notes in them.

Nested Tags will automatically form groups in the Collections View that can be expanded and collapsed.
