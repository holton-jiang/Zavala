Sometimes you have a common Outline that you want to use as a starting point over and over again. Some would call this a template. Zavala doesn’t have formal support for a special type of Outline called a template, but you can make and use any Outline as one.

Let’s say you have a packing list and want to use it for multiple trips. The easiest way to do this is to create your packing list as an Outline. You then use the context menu from the Documents panel to create a copy of your packing list. Rename the copy and mark off items as you pack them. When done, delete the copy. You will still have the original p![](/assets/images/help/61551224-BA52-4B88-BC65-CD57EBF66B5E.png)￼acking list to duplicate the next time you take a trip.
