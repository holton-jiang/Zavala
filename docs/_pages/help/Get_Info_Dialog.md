There are several ways to access the Get Info dialog. You can use the File menu on macOS and you can use the More Options menu on iOS. You can also access it in the context menu on the Outlines column.

## Owner Information

The three owner fields are included in any OPML files you export. This information is optional and is really only useful if you are sharing your OPML files with others. It is fine to leave these fields blank.

## Dates

These are pretty self explanatory. The Created and Updated fields are automatically updated and not user editable.
