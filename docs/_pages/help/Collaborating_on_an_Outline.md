Working on an Outline with someone else that has Zavala and iCloud is simple. You just click the Share icon, either in the toolbar on the Mac or in the More Options menu on iPhone and iPad. You will then be prompted to choose how to send your invitation to collaborate.

Once the other party has accepted, they will be able to view and edit the Outline. Changes to the Outline should be visible to both users within seconds. If the changes donâ€™t appear, you may need to manually refresh the Outline. You can do this using Refresh from the File menu on the Mac or pulling down on the Outline on iPhone and iPad.
