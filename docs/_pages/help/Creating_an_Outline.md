Creating a new outline is pretty simple. Just click the square and pencil button (shown above). The only real trick is letting Zavala know where you want to create the Outline.

All you have to do is select a collection in the Collections View. Typically you do this when you want to have a Tag automatically associated with your new Outline or you want to specify which Account to put it in.
