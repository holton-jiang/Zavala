## Color Palette

You can use this override the default system light mode or dark mode setting.

## Fonts

Various elements of the Outline Editor have configurable fonts. This enables you to customize the Editor to your personal tastes or needs. You can even install your own fonts and select them here to use them.

On iPad and iPhone the Editor will adjust the size of your fonts if you have increased or decreased the font size using [Dynamic Type](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202828).
