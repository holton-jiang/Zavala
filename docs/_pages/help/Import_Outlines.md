If you are coming to Zavala from another outliner application, you can bring your data with you if your existing outliner has an OPML export function. 

* Options
	* macOS
		* You can use the File menu to start the import.
		* You can drag one or more OPML files onto a Tag collection or the All collection to import them and associate that Tag with them.
		* You can drag into the Outlines Column to import into the selected collection.
	* iOS
		* You can use the Import button in either the Collection Column or the Outlines Column
		* You can also drag to the Collection Column or Outlines Column the same way that you can on macOS
