Outlines are a way of structuring information so that it has relationships between pieces of information. They are a hierarchy of rows where each row contains what ever information you think is important.

The same things you might typically do with a note taking application can be done with an outliner. The advantage to using an outliner is that you can show how information relates to each other. Here is an example.

In our example Produce is related to Apples and Carrots. McIntosh and Granny Smith are related to to Apples and through association, to Produce.

## Completed Items

Outlines allow you to track progress by marking Rows as completed. Zavala shows completed rows as being struck through.

Completing items is fast and easy. Just swipe righton a Row as complete or unmark it if you didn’t mean to complete it.

* Outliner Uses
	* Taking notes
	* Managing lists, a shopping list for example
	* Brain storming
	* Task or project planning
	* Task or project management

## Everyday Use

I use outlines everyday to manage this project or just to keep track of what needs done around the house. It seems that people need to try outliners for a while before they full understand how useful they are. Give it a try and don’t give up! You’ll eventually wonder how you got by with just taking free-form notes or using a TODO app.
