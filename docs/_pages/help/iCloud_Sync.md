## Set Up

iCloud syncing is turned on by enabling the iCloud account in the Preferences on macOS and in Settings on iPhone and iPad. You do have to have [iCloud Drive setup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025) to use Zavalaâ€™s iCloud sync. This is a technical requirement from Apple to use their iCloud syncing service.

## Usage

You use the iCloud account just like the On My Device account. If you created Outlines in your On My Device account that you want to sync, you can drag them from the Documents view to the iCloud Account.
