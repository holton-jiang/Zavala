Zavala is a dedicated outliner written for Apple platforms. It is an open source project and will be free forever.
You can find the source code for [Zavala on GitHub](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala).

### Credits

I would like to thank [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) and [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com)
for inspiring this project. Their dedication to outliners and disatisfaction with the current generation of
them is ultimately what got this project going.  In fact John [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1277329886080905219) this:

> I would kill for a good simple outliner that synced across iOS and Mac, and had a great *simple* UI on all three platforms.

If there was a mission statement for Zavala, that would be it.
