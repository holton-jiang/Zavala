Zavala has not yet been released to the public. It is an application in active development.  You should not entrust any important 
information to it.  It could be a little buggy still. I recommend that any important documents you create with it, you back 
up by exporting them as OPML files.

[Pre-release Download](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/releases/latest/download/Zavala.app.zip) (Requires macOS 11 Big Sur)

You can install the [TestFlight.app](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) on your iPad or iPhone and get the TestFlight
version of Zavala for iOS by clicking this [link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/iFbND23m) on your iPhone or iPad.
