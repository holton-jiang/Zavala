title: File Attachments
---



I got a question from a user wondering if we would be adding file attachments to Zavala. I don’t plan on that for a couple reasons. First, I don’t think outliners make good file managers. iCloud Drive is a much better solution. Second, implementing it is involved, especially when factoring in iCloud syncing. 

I have a solution that I think is better and works today in Zavala. Zavala has good support for hypertext linking. You can even link to files using linking. Here is how to do it. 

First, find the file you want to link to in the Finder. Second, use Finder’s copy function. I use ⌘-c myself. Open the link dialog in Zavala. ⌘-k works nicely. Enter a title and then in the link field, do a paste. ⌘-v is fastest.  This will create a hypertext link that when clicked, will open the application associated with this file.

Unfortunately, this only works with Finder and not Files on iOS.

I hope you find this article useful and thank you to everyone who is using Zavala.  

P.S. Some of you may have noticed that the link dialog says Update and it should say Add. I don’t know how I never noticed that before, but I will fix it in an upcoming bug fix release.
