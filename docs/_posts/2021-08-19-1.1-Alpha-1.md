Title: 1.1 Alpha 1
---

Zavala 1.1 is now ready for testing on iOS. It won't be available on the Mac for testing
in this release. Because of how Apple distributes App Store apps, it isn't yet possible
to test Zavala by directly distributing it like we did with the 1.0 version. Eventually
we will be able to with TestFlight for Mac coming in macOS 12 Moneterey.

A word of caution. It will automatically update
the on disk database, so once you begin using Zavala 1.1, you can't go back to 1.0. Also if
you are using iCloud to sync to a Mac, opening an outline with images embedded in it on the
Mac will cause those images to be lost.

You can get the [the iOS version](https://testflight.apple.com/join/iFbND23m) 
on TestFlight.
