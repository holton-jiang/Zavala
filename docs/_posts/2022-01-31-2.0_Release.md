title: 2.0 Release
---



The next big version of Zavala is now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zavala/id1546457750). There are a lot of big changes in v2 of Zavala.

We now have extensive support Shortcuts. I tried to make everything about an outline scriptable. Check out the new [Help](https://zavala.vincode.io/help/Zavala_Help.md/) for [how to use them](https://zavala.vincode.io/help/Programming_Guide.md/) and for some [nifty examples](https://zavala.vincode.io/help/Shortcut_Examples.md/). The possibilities for extending Zavala are limitless.

The Go Backward and Go Forward buttons really help navigating if you are interconnecting Outlines using [links](https://zavala.vincode.io/help/Link_Dialog.md/) or even just working with more than one Outline at a time. This is great for building an interconnected personal knowledgebase.

[Brad Ellis](https://twitter.com/BradEllis) provided a lot of design input into v2 of Zavala and I feel that it greatly improved the app. Check out the new control to add Tags to an Outline for an example of Brad’s amazing work. We also did many smaller tweaks that make the app feel more polished and professionally done.

To top it all off, we have a set of professionally made icons from Brad.![](/assets/images/21C610AD-19B8-4E3F-9033-586C6534D94B.png)￼
