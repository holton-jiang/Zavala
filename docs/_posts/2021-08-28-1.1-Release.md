Title: 1.1 Release
---

Zavala 1.1 has been released!

I'm pretty happy with this release. It has a number of features missing from the initial
release that are common to other outliners.  Additionally you can can now embed images in your outlines, 
which isn't so common among outliners (to the best of my knowledge). It also has a number of bug fixes and performance improvements.

You can [download Zavala](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zavala/id1546457750) from the App Store. You can 
provide feedback on this release in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vincode-io/Zavala/discussions/119).
