Title: 1.0.0 Beta 2
---

## I got some good feedback in Beta 1

I’d like to thank everyone who contributed feedback either through TestFlight or GitHub issues. It is always enlightening when other people use your software. For sure, they will use it in a way that you didn’t anticipate.

An example of this is that I expected outline users to almost always use the keyboard to create new rows. I didn’t provide a way for the user to tap the outline to get started. I expected them to hit enter from the tag entry field.

This caused some users a good deal of confusion. This has been fixed in Beta 2. You can now go straight to editing the outline rows with a tap and bypass the Title and Tags.

I also got some feedback that couldn’t be included in the 1.0 release. Some bigger things will have to wait for the 1.1 release. The good news is that work on 1.1 has already begun and should be ready in a month or so.
